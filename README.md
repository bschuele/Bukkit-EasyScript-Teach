# Bukkit-EasyScript-Teach

This is a fork of easyscript with some modifications to make it more suited to
a whole bunch of kids all learning to code on the same MC server all at once

 **Planned Modifications**
 - When a player uses the /script command it executes scripts that they have written by default 
 - Add a command to unbind/ force reload scripts written by a specific player instead of the whole server
   - So that we don't interrupt someone
 - Associate console errors from EasyScript with the player that caused them
 - If all goes to plan this will be used with [node-spell-server][1]
