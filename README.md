# Bukkit-EasyScript (Teach)

This is a fork of easyscript with some modifications to make it more suited to
a whole bunch of kids all learning to code on the same MC server all at once

 **Planned Modifications**
 - When a player uses the /script command it executes scripts that they have written by default 
 - Add a command to unbind/ force reload scripts written by a specific player
 - perhaps add a small amount of built ins to let the kids have a little bit of instant gratification on day 1 of lessons
